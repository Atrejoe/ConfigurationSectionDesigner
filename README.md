## HELP REQUESTED
I have very little time to maintain this at the moment, so please feel free to fork and submit PULL requests. If you are providing good quality contributions and would like to be added as a maintainer of this project, let me know. Thank you!

## Future Goals
This tool has a lot of potential if some significant enhancements are implemented:
+ Ability to support AspNetCore JSON configuration/options.
+ More customization ability for generated code.
+ What else?
