Have you encountered a bug? Have you got an idea for a great new feature? Are you wondering how to do something? Do you want to tell us how much you like the tool, or how much you hate the tool? Please do not hesitate to voice your concern, ideas, questions or feedback! Below is a list of what to do when, and again, no problem or idea is too small. If we know how to fix it, we'll fix it, if we know how to implement it, we'll implement it and if we have an answer to your question, we'll answer it.

* For bugs, first [url:check the list of issues|http://csd.codeplex.com/WorkItem/List.aspx] to see if somebody else already has reported the problem you're experiencing. If they have, feel free to vote the issue up and/or leave your own comments on the existing bug report. If it seems the problem you are experiencing has not been reported, please [url:file a new work item|http://csd.codeplex.com/WorkItem/Create.aspx] for it. Please be as specific as you can: What you did, can you reproduce the issue, and other things you think may be able to help us fix the bug.
* For feature requests and ideas, first [url:check the list of issues|http://csd.codeplex.com/WorkItem/List.aspx] to see if somebody else already has requested the feature you're seeking or has voiced the idea you're having. If they have, feel free to vote the issue up and/or leave your own comments on the existing feature request. If it seems the feature you are requesting has not been suggested, please [url:file a new work item|http://csd.codeplex.com/WorkItem/Create.aspx] for it. Please be as specific as you can about your idea, so that we may understand your intention the best. See [url:this issue|http://csd.codeplex.com/WorkItem/View.aspx?WorkItemId=3416] for how not to suggest a feature. Sure, it got included, but I have no idea if how I did it was anything like the person wanted.
* For any other kind of feedback, such as acclaim, criticism and questions, please use the [url:dicussion forum|http://csd.codeplex.com/Thread/List.aspx].
